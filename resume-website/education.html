            <h3>University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa</h3>
            <h4>BSc Computer Science (Jan 2021 – Mar 2024)</h4>
            <p>
              My time at Wits was nothing short of transformative. I dove into
              the world of software engineering, learning the ins and outs of
              algorithms, machine learning, data structures, and operating
              systems. The university pushed me beyond my limits, providing me
              with a solid foundation in computer science that I apply daily in
              my work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wits wasn’t just about the academics, though—this is where I truly
              grew as a programmer, thinker, and collaborator. Between working
              on fascinating projects and constantly challenging myself to stay
              on top of emerging tech trends, I walked away not just with a
              degree but with lifelong skills and memories. Some of my favorite
              courses included: Software Design, Machine Learning, Data
              Structures and Algorithms, Advanced Analysis of Algorithms, and
              Multivariable Calculus.

            <p>
              My time at Liberty High was filled with achievements and
              leadership opportunities. I proudly participated in the Computer
              Applications Technology competition, earning a bronze certificate
              in 2019 and a silver certificate in 2020. I was also elected into
              leadership roles, serving as a prefect in Grade 11 and rising to
              head prefect in my final year, 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished top of my class in Grade 12, earning a scholarship from
              the University of the Witwatersrand to study Computer Science.
              Before that, I ranked first in Grades 10 and 11, and that
              consistency kept me motivated throughout my high school journey.

            <h3>U-TECH, Swaziland (Jan 2015 - Dec 2017)</h3>
            <p>
              At U-TECH, I got a taste of success early on, participating in the
              Swaziland Science Expo and winning a bronze medal in Grade 9.
              Leadership came naturally to me, and I served as a prefect in
              Grades 9 and 10. I was always striving for excellence, securing
              second place in Grade 8, and finishing first in both Grades 9 and
              10.
